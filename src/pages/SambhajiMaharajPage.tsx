            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              In February 1689, the course of Maratha history was forever altered. Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, through an act of betrayal, was captured by Mughal forces at Sangameshwar. He was brought in chains to the camp of Emperor Aurangzeb, the man who had spent nearly a decade trying, and failing, to conquer his kingdom.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Brought before the mighty emperor, Sambhaji Maharaj was not a broken man. He stood with the pride of a king, his eyes reflecting an unbroken spirit. Aurangzeb made him an offer, believing he could finally break the Maratha will. The terms were clear:

            <ul className="text-lg leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside text-right space-y-2">
                <li>Surrender all your forts.</li>

        <section className="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-10 md:gap-16 mb-16 md:mb-24">

            <h2 className="font-serif text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 pb-2 border-b-2 border-red-200">Absolute Defiance</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              To a lesser man, this would have been a lifeline. For Sambhaji Maharaj, it was an insult. He looked at the emperor and scornfully rejected the offer. Legends say his reply was filled with such fearless contempt that it stunned the entire Mughal court. He made it clear that he would choose a thousand deaths over a life of dishonor and abandoning his Dharma. He declared that the Maratha spirit of freedom was not for sale.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Enraged by this absolute defiance, Aurangzeb ordered a brutal execution. Yet, through unimaginable pain, Sambhaji Maharaj never relented. His refusal to bow down, even in the face of certain death, was his final act of resistance. His sacrifice did not crush the Marathas; it ignited a fire of vengeance and unity that ultimately consumed Mughal ambitions. This single, powerful act is why he is remembered as Dharmaveerâ€”the valiant protector of righteousness.
